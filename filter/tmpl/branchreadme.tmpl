This is `{{.Name}}`. I have put it into a command branch for inclusion into my c Bonzai stateful command tree.

## Installation

If you just want to try it out, grab the release binary with curl and put into your PATH:

curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/{{.Name}}/releases/latest/download/{{.Name}}-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/{{.Name}}
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/{{.Name}}/releases/latest/download/{{.Name}}-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/{{.Name}}
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/{{.Name}}/releases/latest/download/{{.Name}}-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/{{.Name}}
```

Or with `go`:

```shell
go install github.com/tr00datp00nar/{{.Name}}/cmd/{{.Name}}@latest
```

Composed

```go
package c

import (
	Z "github.com/rwxrob/bonzai/z"
    "github.com/tr00datp00nar/{{.Name}}"
)

var Cmd = &Z.Cmd{
	Name:     'c',
    Commands: []*Z.Cmd{help.Cmd, {{.Name}}.Cmd},
}
```
